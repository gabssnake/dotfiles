Review documentation for accuracy and conciseness. Check:
- Is it up to date with the current code?
- Does it describe actual behavior, not outdated assumptions?
- Are examples still valid?

Improve by:
- Removing verbose explanations that don't help the reader
- Focusing on what users need to know to use the code
- Explaining why things work a certain way, not restating the code
- Cutting filler phrases and redundant sections

Make the changes directly, don't just recommend.

If multiple files need review, use parallel agents to process them concurrently.
