First, run /review-project to understand the project thoroughly.

Then create/update a README.md that helps people discover and use the project.

Follow this structure:
1. Title and one-liner - Project name and single sentence describing what it does
2. What it does - Bullet points of key capabilities (not how, just what)
3. Quick start - Fastest path to seeing it work (link to demo, or minimal commands)
4. Local setup - Prerequisites, dependencies, and commands to run locally
5. Contributing (optional) - Links to docs for extending the project

Guidelines:
- Keep it short and pragmatic
- Focus on key facts, not prose
- Help someone returning after months to quickly re-orient
- Use code blocks for commands
- List concrete prerequisites (versions, tools)
- Prefer bullet points over paragraphs

When reviewing:
- Verify information is accurate and current
- Confirm referenced files exist
