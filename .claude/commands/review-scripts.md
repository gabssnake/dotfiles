description: Critical review of scripts for simplicity and minimalism
allowed-tools: Read, Glob, Grep, Bash, Task
---

Review Bash and JavaScript scripts in this project.

Understand how scripts work together, then assess:
- Opportunities to simplify
- Unnecessary code to remove
- Logic that can be consolidated
- Over-engineering (abstractions, utilities that don't pay off)
- Unnecessary dependencies

Guidelines:
- Prefer plain, minimal implementations
- Accept some duplication over premature abstraction
- Keep things decoupled and extensible
- Built-in solutions over external dependencies

Use parallel agents to review different scripts concurrently.
Don't make changes directly, present options for review.
