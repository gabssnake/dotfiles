Review this project holistically. Understand:
- What the project does and its core purpose
- How it achieves that purpose (architecture, flow, key components)

Critically assess:
- Redundancies (duplicated logic, overlapping modules)
- Incoherencies (inconsistent naming, mixed conventions)
- Over-engineering (abstractions that don't pay off)
- Opportunities for simplification

Provide concise findings with specific recommendations. Prioritize high-impact improvements.

Use parallel agents to explore different parts concurrently.
