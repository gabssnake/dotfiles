description: Critical review of project structure and design
allowed-tools: Read, Glob, Grep, Bash

Take a step back and review this project holistically. Understand:
- What the project does and its core purpose
- How it achieves that purpose (architecture, flow, key components)

Then critically assess:
- Redundancies (duplicated logic, overlapping modules, repeated patterns)
- Incoherencies (inconsistent naming, mixed conventions, contradictory approaches)
- Over-engineering (abstractions that don't pay off, unused flexibility)
- Opportunities for simplification

Provide a concise summary of findings with specific recommendations. Prioritize high-impact improvements over minor issues.

Use as many parallel agents as possible to accelerate understanding different parts of the project concurrently.
