description: Review and improve CLAUDE.md and commands
---

Review ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md and ~/.claude/commands/ for effectiveness, conciseness, and clarity.

Identify:
- Redundancy or overlap between instructions
- Ambiguous phrasing
- Missing guidance for common scenarios
- Commands that could be consolidated or improved

Important:
- When commands seem very specific, keep them as such
- Avoid over generalization that dilutes critical tokens

Make improvements directly.
