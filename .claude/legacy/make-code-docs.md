Review inline documentation for accuracy and conciseness.

Check:
- Is it up to date with current code?
- Does it describe actual behavior, not outdated assumptions?
- Are examples still valid?

Improve by:
- Removing verbose explanations that don't help the reader
- Focusing on what users need to know to use the code
- Explaining why, not restating what the code does

Preferences:
- Prefer short, lowercase, factual messages.

Make changes directly. Use parallel agents for multiple files.
