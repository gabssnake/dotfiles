Review comments in this code. Remove:
- Comments that restate what the code does
- Comments describing obvious behavior

Keep comments that:
- Explain "why" something is done a certain way
- Provide context not inferable from code
- Warn about non-obvious gotchas

Fix formatting: lowercase start, no trailing punctuation.

Make changes directly. Use parallel agents for multiple files.
